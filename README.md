# profile-pic-generator-discord

This is an example output of the program: 

![](output.png)

Instructions:

python ./picgen.py <bg_color> <circle_color> <face_color>

Where it says <x_color> you put a hexcode color without the # sign. The image will be in the same directory called `output.png`.

If you want to use the discord bot feature, open `bot.py`, and add your bot token at the bottom.

The bot will have a single command, `!gen <bg_color> <circle_color> <face_color>`, same way to use as command line arguments.
